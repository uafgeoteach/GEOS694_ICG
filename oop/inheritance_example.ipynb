    "\n",
    "Inheritance is an object oriented programming defined as the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining similar implementation. It is also defined as deriving new classes (sub classes) from existing ones such as super class or base class and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inheritance is used to replicate behavior across many classes\n",
    "- Inheritance exists in Python, and I will demonstrate it here in this example notebook.\n",
    "- It is an advanced topic that sometimes causes more trouble than its worth\n",
    "- Godo to know it exists and that you can use it, but okay if you never think about it"

    "\n",
    "- Inheritance exists and is meant to reduce code complexity by sharing class methods and attributes\n",
    "- Child classes can inherit from parents using the `super()` function\n",
    "- Child classes can overwrite and override parent methods and attributes for additional flexibility\n",
    "- While powerful, this can lead to loss of readability because a user may need to track back through parents to find the original definition.\n",
